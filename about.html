        <p>My Name is Dante and I'm twenty years old. I'm a college student who wants to learn how to create websites. I like to play videogames, learn more about technology, and experience new knowledge about html. I want to create simple but good websites in the beginning. When I get better with html and other resources, I want to create harder and better websites in the future. The reason why I chose to be a computer science major because I was interested in technology when I was 10 years old. My grandpa showed me his old computer and taught me how to play games. When I played the games on the old computer, I had alot of fun. After that moment, I started to invest into more games, then learned about the coding aspects. When I found out that this college has computer programs, I had to go here so I can learn more about coding/technology. </p>
